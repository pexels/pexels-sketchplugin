# Pexels Plugin

## Installation

- [Download the latest version](https://github.com/pexels/pexels-sketchplugin/releases/latest/download/pexels.sketchplugin.zip).
- Unzip & double click it to install.

## Features

Get images from [Pexels](https://pexels.com), using Sketch’s Data Supplier feature.

You can use it from the toolbar Data icon, from the contextual menu for any layer, or even for Overrides using the Inspector.

When you’ve set an image fill for a layer, you can later on open the original URL for an image, in case you need to get the full credits, or download the original file, etc. To do that, click Plugins › Pexels › View Photo on Pexels. It does not work for overrides yet, but we’re working on it!
